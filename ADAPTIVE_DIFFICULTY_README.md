# Adaptive Difficulty System

## Overview

The Adaptive Difficulty System is a comprehensive learning analytics and AI-powered question generation system that automatically adjusts the difficulty of educational content based on student performance. It tracks multiple metrics including accuracy, response time, and hint usage to provide a personalized learning experience.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Performance Tracking

- **Accuracy Monitoring**: Tracks correct vs incorrect answers
- **Response Time Analysis**: Measures how quickly students answer questions
- **Hint Usage Tracking**: Monitors how often students need help
- **Real-time Analytics**: Updates performance metrics in real-time

### ðŸ§  Adaptive Logic

- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Automatically increases/decreases difficulty based on performance
- **Smart Thresholds**:
  - Increase difficulty if accuracy > 85% and avg time < 20s
  - Decrease difficulty if accuracy < 50% or hint count > 3
- **Range Control**: Maintains difficulty between levels 1-3

### ðŸ¤– AI Question Generation

- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for dynamic question generation
- **Difficulty-Based Prompts**: Different prompts for easy, medium, and hard questions
- **Question Caching**: Stores generated questions for reuse and offline access
- **Retry Logic**: Handles API failures with fallback to cached questions

### ðŸ“Š Analytics Dashboard

- **Performance Visualization**: Charts and metrics for student progress
- **Question History**: Detailed log of all attempted questions
- **Difficulty Distribution**: Shows breakdown of questions by difficulty level
- **Real-time Updates**: Live performance tracking

## Components

### Hooks

#### `useAdaptiveDifficulty(topic: string)`

Main hook for managing adaptive difficulty functionality.

**Returns:**

- `currentProgress`: Current student progress data
- `currentDifficulty`: Current difficulty level (1-3)
- `accuracy`: Current accuracy percentage
- `avgResponseTime`: Average response time in seconds
- `startQuestionTimer()`: Start timing a question
- `getElapsedTime()`: Get time elapsed since timer started
- `updateStudentProgress()`: Update progress with adaptive logic
- `generateAIQuestion()`: Generate AI question for difficulty level
- `getCachedQuestion()`: Get cached question for difficulty level

### Components

#### `PerformanceTracker`

Reusable component for displaying performance metrics.

**Props:**

- `topic`: The learning topic
- `showDetails`: Whether to show detailed stats
- `className`: Additional CSS classes

#### `AdaptiveDifficultyDashboard`

Comprehensive dashboard for viewing adaptive difficulty analytics.

**Features:**

- Topic selector for different learning areas
- Performance overview cards
- Detailed statistics
- Question history with filtering
- Real-time updates

## Integration Example

```tsx
import { useAdaptiveDifficulty } from "@/hooks/useAdaptiveDifficulty";

const MyGame = () => {
  const {
    currentDifficulty,
    startQuestionTimer,
    getElapsedTime,
    updateStudentProgress,
    generateAIQuestion,
  } = useAdaptiveDifficulty("word_scramble");

  const handleQuestionStart = () => {
    startQuestionTimer();
    // Generate AI question based on current difficulty
    generateAIQuestion(currentDifficulty);
  };

  const handleAnswerSubmit = async (isCorrect: boolean, userAnswer: string) => {
    const responseTime = getElapsedTime();

    // Update progress with adaptive logic
    await updateStudentProgress(isCorrect, responseTime, hintsUsed, {
      questionText: "Your question text",
      userAnswer: userAnswer,
      correctAnswer: "Correct answer",
      aiGenerated: false,
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Difficulty: {currentDifficulty}/3</p>
      {/* Your game UI */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## API Integration

### OpenAI Configuration

The system uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for question generation. Ensure your environment variables are set:

```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Question Generation Prompts

**Level 1 (Easy):**

```
Create an easy English vocabulary question suitable for 6th grade students.
The question should test basic word meanings and simple grammar concepts.
```

**Level 2 (Medium):**

```
Create a medium-difficulty English question suitable for 6th grade students.
The question should test intermediate vocabulary, grammar rules, and reading comprehension.
```

**Level 3 (Hard):**

```
Create a challenging English question suitable for advanced 6th grade students.
The question should test complex vocabulary, advanced grammar concepts, and critical thinking.
```

## Error Handling

### Retry Logic

- Maximum 3 retries for OpenAI API calls
- Fallback to cached questions if API fails
- Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages

### Data Validation

- Prevents data corruption with validation checks
- Handles edge cases like negative values
- Maintains data integrity with constraints

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy

- Questions are cached in Supabase for reuse
- Reduces API calls and improves response time
- Enables offline functionality

### Database Indexes

- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Efficient performance tracking
- Fast question history retrieval
